# Melody: A Full-Stack Music-Centric Social Media Platform

## Overview

Melody is a cutting-edge, full-stack social media platform designed for music enthusiasts. It allows users to share their favorite songs, create playlists, and connect with others based on musical tastes. This project showcases proficiency in modern web development technologies and best practices.

## Key Features

- User authentication and profile management
- Music sharing and discovery
- Social interactions (follows, comments, likes)
- Playlist creation and sharing
- Music recommendation system
- Integration with third-party music services

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js
- React Router for navigation
- State management with React Hooks and Context API
- Responsive design with CSS modules

### Backend
- Python with FastAPI framework
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions
- Pydantic for data validation and settings management

### API Layer
- Express.js for RESTful API endpoints
- Middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling

### Database
- PostgreSQL for efficient and reliable data storage

### Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication and third-party service integration

## Architecture

Melody follows a modern, scalable architecture:

1. **Frontend (React.js)**: Provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.
2. **API Layer (Express.js)**: Acts as an intermediary, handling requests from the frontend and communicating with the backend services.
3. **Backend Services (Python/FastAPI)**: Manages core business logic, data processing, and third-party integrations.
4. **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores user data, content, and relationships.

This separation of concerns allows for scalability, maintainability, and easier testing.

## Key Implementations

1. **RESTful API**: Designed and implemented a robust API using Express.js, showcasing understanding of RESTful principles.
2. **Database Design**: Efficiently modeled complex relationships between users, posts, and music data.
3. **Authentication**: Implemented OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication and third-party service integration.
4. **State Management**: Utilized React Hooks and Context API for efficient state management in the frontend.
5. **Asynchronous Operations**: Handled asynchronous operations effectively in both frontend and backend.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented database indexing and query optimization to handle large datasets efficiently.
2. **Real-time Features**: Utilized WebSockets for real-time notifications and updates.
3. **Scalability**: Designed the architecture to be horizontally scalable, allowing for easy expansion as the user base grows.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement machine learning-based recommendation system
- Add support for user-generated content like cover songs or remixes
- Integrate with more third-party music streaming services
- Develop mobile applications for iOS and Android
